          <h2>Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
          <p>
            The Government College (Autonomous), Rajahmundry is proud to
            proclaim that we are providing a world class education coupled with
            life skills, soft skills and ethics for more than one and half
            centuries and is known as Abode of Excellence, a campus of
            inspiration. We know the fact that each student is different in
            terms of personality and learning abilities. 
          </p> <br>
            <p> We also believe that
            powerful teaching learning occurs with shared spirit of
            responsibility and temperament which creates a passionate learning
            experience to students and the college is known for its warmth,
            energy and excellence in these lines. Initially established in the
            year 1853 as zilla School, upgraded into higher education institute
            in the year 1873, the college has been producing gems of students
            for adornment of mother India and spreading the knowledge across the
            globe. The students of this Alma matter were later turned to be
            giants in various spheres globally. The various programs offered by
            the college would stimulate the intellectual curiosity of each
            student and foster a positive spirit among the stakeholders with the
            support of committed staff who are striving to create a milieu that
            sustains excellence. 
          </p> <br>
            <p> Our pursuit of high academic attainment with
            the support of all the staff and parents makes us distinct among
            other higher educational institutions in the State. </p> <br>
          <p>This is
            evidenced by the continuous achievements of “Pratibha Awards” by
            students every year, which is being given to the topper in each
            subject in the State by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Education
            does not only mean academic excellence alone, but it is coordination
            between Intellectual Power, Skills and Ethical values. </p> <br> 
          <p> Our slogan is
            “Student First” and we enjoy taking the challenge of nurturing the
            young minds, the future citizens of the nation, with the indelible
            impressions of a holistic education and make him/her as a vibrant
            student, above all, a generous and sentient human being.
          </p>
